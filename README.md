# wefox
A project for the wefox team. The project uses Kafka Streams, PostGreSQL, and Rest API.

If I had more time for the test then:

1. I would have done some more refactoring, and added some tests (incl use of Mockito!).
2. I had an error and I would have investigated that too (the about there being no body).
3. I would have conformed to the original database shchema, I created a simplier one to save time (see image in repo).

That was fun. Cheers!
